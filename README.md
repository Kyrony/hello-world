# hello-world

I began my journey isolated due to the pandemic.
I initially spend a lot of time learning Python, Jupyter, and Django over quarantine (May 2020-May 2021). 
From May 2021 - August 2021 I focused on HTML, CSS, and SASS.
From August 2021 - November 2021 I have spent my time learning Javascript, Figma, and SEO.
Now I am focusing on GIT and my Open Source presence.
My goal is to land a Front End Developer Job by March of 2022.

Thank you for taking the time to read my initial POST!
